# Pixos
Pixos is a clipped compound of Pix (Pics) and Operating System (OS) - hence Pixos. 

Pixos is an open-source platform for handling photos, documents and files. 
It provides a great touch interface for interacting with data files and is multimedia rich. 
To be added unto the platform is the ability to play videos and open URLs.
